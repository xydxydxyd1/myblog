Once upon a time, there was a great kingdom next to the ocean. Scholars flocked
there for knowledge, merchants for wealth, and adventurers for glory.

How did this kingdom come to be filled with beauty, truth, and wealth? "The
Marisolha," they answered, "the Sea of the Sun."  The people of the kingdom
was blessed with power by the ocean. This allowed the kingdom to spread its
influence further and further.

Centuries passed, and the kingdom became more and more powerful. That is, until
a certain curious fool wondered where the power that enabled them come from. The
fool convinced the kingdom to not praise the golden sea, but conquer it.
"Set sail!" he said to the people, "Find that power which made us so great, and
make it our own!" "Set sail!" the people responded.

And so, the fool led the people of the kingdom on a golden armada. Thunder and
lightning battered the crew as if God was trying to dissuade the fools, but they
pressed on.

After ten days at nights, they reached the center of the Marisolha. "We did it!"
The people celebrated and prepared for the descent into the ocean. They prepared
golden pods, eyes, and arms for themselves. They readied themselves. They dived.
They saw a golden light. Deeper. The light became stronger. Deeper. They saw
something at the center. Deeper. Deeper...

Then they saw the heart of the abyss. The truth.

The light vanished. Black tendrils slashed through the water, through the people,
one, two. "Run! Run!" the people screamed, their voice drowned in their sea of
gold. The darkness consumed the golden fools, the golden armada, and eventually,
the golden kingdom.

And thus, the bards' songs turned into wails, and they called the armada, one
never seen before and never seen again, the Ship of Fools, Stultifera Navis.
