Starting a new project is very exciting, which is why I'm on my bed at 3 am
writing this instead of sleeping.

# Who am I

I'm Eric, a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate student at UC Davis. My
interest is how computers work. For example, how these words go from keyboard,
to file, to server, then to you.

# What is this website

In class, I often share fun stuff related to class on the class forums, such as
applications of something we just learned or the reasoning behind some design.
Day before yesterday (Christmas Eve), I wanted to share what I learned about
directory permissions in Unix with my operating system classmates, and I
woefully realize that probably no one will read the class forum during break.

Thus, I decided to make a blog. It will be a vent for my desire to learn and
share what I learned, and I hope that you can learn something new from here!

# Contact me

If you found out that I wrote something wrong or didn't cover something very
interesting, feel free to shoot me an email at
[yundi.eric.xu@gmail.com](mailto:yundi.eric.xu@gmail.com). I
absolutely welcome any discussion regarding the things I wrote. Maybe we can
learn even more things together!
