Starting a new project is very exciting, which is why I'm on my bed at 3 am
writing this instead of sleeping.

# Who am I

I'm Eric, a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate student at UC Davis. My
interest is how computers work. For example, how these words go from keyboard,
to file, to server, then to you.

# What is this website

In class, I often share fun stuff related to class on the class forums, such as
applications of something we just learned or the reasoning behind some design.

``` bash
$ hexo new "My New Post"
```
